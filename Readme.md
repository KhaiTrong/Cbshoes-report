# Cbshoes-report
CBshoes is a fictional company (based on real-life Schuh retail in the U.K) I did this as an assignment for my Msc. but I expand on it with visualization and storytelling. The data for this project is provided by Dr.Dong Hoang from Leeds Beckett University (UK). This project is mainly done via Excel, Powerquery and Tableau for visualization and data storytelling

The purpose of this report is to create: a) a compelling and relevant narrative b)highlighting key data c) providing insights and how these might drive change to the business.

The shorter data storytelling version can be found here: [datastorytelling](https://public.tableau.com/views/cbshoes/website-session-and-users?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**I. Background** 
CBshoes is a shoe retailer brand operating in the U.K, this report is created to be viewed by the business development and marketing executive team. For that reason this report will be leaning on marketing analytics. The first part of the report is about traditional metris which include sales, socio-demomgraphic and sales by brands.

In 2020, the online channel contributed up to 68,93% (~69%) of total revenue, the  rest was from retail stores sales. This indicates that the firm may have successfully 
implemented its digital resolutions to cope with the changes in consumers shopping behavior. Due to the pandemic, Small and Medium Businesses (SMEs) have  prioritized digital transformation to be one of the key solutions[^1].
Meanwhile, the physical store sales is accounted for over a quarter of total revenuess, indicating the capabilities of CB shoes in omni-channel transformation, which has long been essential for businesses [^2] and only gets more accelerated due to the pandemic. 

Based on sales quantity by brands there is a few that stands out:
- Ugg has the most sales in 2020. even though it's  a luxury brand, 
- Lelli Kelly - a brand known for  children's footwear follows at 2nd place. Kids' products are not made to last, for this reason, they have higher price elasticity 
of demand, thus brands can drop the price points lower, resulting in higher sales. 

What can be made of this is a) product attributes (e.g., quality, purpose, availability) remains impactful to purchasing decision, even during pandemic

b) The parents cohort customer and/or first-time parents are still considerable purchasing power, during the pandemic, parents tend to 
buy more clothes for their children, the purchasing frequency increases because kids outgrow their apparels/footwear very quickly, according to Sucharita Kodali, principal analyst at Forrester [^3]. Furthermore, Kids' products are not made to last, for this reason, they have higher price elasticity of demand, thus brands can drop the price points lower, resulting in higher sales. Explaining on this further, please
